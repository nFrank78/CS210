# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created an app that reads a list of items sold in a given day from a file and then counts the amount of time each item occurs. It can display a specific item and it's individual occurences if prompted, a list of the items and their occurences if prompted, or a histogram of the items if prompted.
    
# What did you do particularly well?
I think I made the program menu loop particularly well and clean that is easy to use and works well and clears the screen after each choice as not to clutter it up.
    
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think my code for what is available is fine but i could enhance the program by adding more options and perhaps a database so that more day's items could be added and compared and compiled. This would add more utility purpose to the program and could make the decisions made by those using the program more educated and efficient, thus meaning the program is more efficient and encompassing.
    
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I think the most difficult part of the code is the C++ coding to allow the use of Python code as well. This was handed down but still, implementing two languages together is a bit complex and I need more work on getting that code down. The reading and writing to and from files was only a bit challenging because I had forgotten the exact codeing for that and simply needed to go back to the reading.
    
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think the skills that will be most transferable to other projects will be the reading and writing from and to files in my programming. This is likely to be used very frequently in coding projects in general.
    
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made it maintainable and readable by adding inline comments to explain my code and industry standard naming practices so that each function or variable could be as much self-explanatory as possible.
